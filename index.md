### Assignment 13

<p align="center">Please work on: <b>Questions 1, 3, 4</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">Do all work with your group on the provided whiteboard panels. Designate one group member per week to do all whiteboard writing, and rotate this every week. No notebooks! Take a picture of your whiteboard before erasing (recommended everyone takes their own picture). One group member should be designated per week to submit all pictures on OnQ, into the "Labtorial x upload" dropbox. These should be uploaded by the end of the labtorial period (5:30pm). <i><b>Whiteboard pictures are not graded on correctness, and do not count towards your assignment submission. Everyone should submit their own individual write-up of the assignment by midnight on Friday.</b></i></p>

<p align="justify">Each week (with no quiz) one group will be chosen to lead a group discussion on one of the designated tutorial questions, starting with any work they've done. These discussions will be for the last 10-15 minutes of the tutorial section time slot.</p>

### Lab 13-14 - Two Week Lab

You can use LaTeX (lay-tech) math notation to input formulae, etc. into your reports by enclosing statements with dollar signs in a markdown (regular text) cell. $Everything in here would be in math mode!$ In the math mode environment, you can use LaTeX syntax to make it look nicer. Useful ones include;

<p align="center">Fractions: $\frac{numerator}{denominator}$</p>
<p align="center">Super/subscripts: $x^{superscript}_{subscript}$</p>
<p align="center">Integrals: $\int^{upper limit}_{lower limit}$</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols">Pretty much any greek letter or math symbol you can think of!</a></p>

* <i>One lab submission per group - try to have a different member submit each week</i>.
* Download the 'Labtorial13-14' file from Week 13 (in Winter Weekly Schedule!) on OnQ (extension .ipynb). This is another two week lab.
* Log into <a href="https://queensu.syzygy.ca/">Syzygy</a> using your NetID, and upload your notebook.
* Refer to Appendix C of your textbook for guidelines on report writing!
* Be sure to delete all prompt text i.e. "double click to edit and answer questions".
