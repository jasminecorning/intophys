# Week 2

Welcome to PHYS104/106! This is a simple web resource I'll maintain with details pertaining to the labs/tutorials of the course, including: current group configurations, assignment questions to focus on in tutorial, tips and tricks for the lab software. To find course resources for all aspects of the class, go to OnQ.

### Lab Groups

<p><i>Group 8:</i> Tara Meikle, Sophie Harterre, Don Kim, Maxwell Dollar</p>
<p><i>Group 9:</i> Chloe Graham, Kamyl Hornung, Alex Veron, Yukun Wu</p>
<p><i>Group 10:</i> Yididya Tesema, Katrina Stanfield, Jack Willis, Jaden Blackman</p>
<p><i>Group 11:</i> Lilli Mercer, Salma Kinawi, Sean MacCarthy, Owen McIntosh</p>
<p><i>Group 12:</i> Cory Gignac, Zhengyang Yu, Kokoa Fujimaki, Jeong Kim</p>
<p><i>Group 13:</i> Emma Sullivan, Lizzie Mitchell, Jocelyn Armstrong, Ava Galloway</p>

### Housekeeping

How do I submit <i>*insert deliverable here*</i>? When do I need to do <i>*insert assignment here*</i>? I know, there's quite a few moving parts! This section aims to detail each one and when/how they need to be completed. The course is very repetitive, so the good thing is these won't change from now until April. All these details can also be found in the syllabus on OnQ.
<p><b>Quizzes:</b> Every two weeks, written on paper at the start of the labtorial section (starting in Week 2, so they will only be on even numbered weeks). Done individually and in lab groups. Marked by TA. Worth a combined 20% of the final grade.</p>
<p><b>Labs:</b> Done every week during half of the labtorial time slot (between 1-1.5 hours, depending on if there is a quiz - see above!), due at the end of the day Wednesday. One submission per group as a PDF to OnQ. Later in the term, you will have two weeks to complete more involved labs. Marked by TA. Worth a combined 20% of the final grade.</p>
<p><b>Assignments:</b> Due every week at 11:59pm on Friday, uploaded individually to Crowdmark. You will work through questions as a group in the tutorial section of the labtorials (between 1-1.5 hours) and submit pictures to OnQ to show progress, but these <i>do not</i> count towards your final assignment submission. Marked by upper year undergraduate graders. Worth a combined 20% of the final grade.</p>
<p><b>Reading Assignments:</b> Due every Sunday at 11:59pm, completed on Qlicker. Based on the assigned readings from the textbook, consisting mostly of multiple choice questions and a few long answers. Long answers marked by TA. Worth a combined 5% of the final grade.</p>
<p><b>Assimiliation Quizzes:</b> Due every Sunday at 11:5pm, completed on Qlicker. Based on content of the previous week, consisting of multiple choice questions. Automatically graded. Worth a combined 5% of the final grade.</p>
<p><b>End-of-Term Exam:</b> Completed on paper, in groups and individually. There is no midterm (December exam serves as 'midterm'). Marked by TAs, anonymously. Worth 25% of the final grade each.</p>

### Assignment 2 (First Assignment)

<p align="center">Please work on: <b>Questions 3, 4, and 6</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">Do all work with your group on the provided whiteboard panels. You should designate one group member per week to do all whiteboard writing, and rotate this role every week. No notebooks! Take a picture of your whiteboard before erasing thoroughly (recommended everyone takes their own picture). One group member should be designated each week to submit all pictures on OnQ, into the "Labtorial x upload" dropbox. These should be uploaded by the end of the labtorial period (5:30pm). <i><b>Whiteboard pictures are not graded on correctness, and do not count towards your assignment submission. Everyone should submit their own individual write-up of the assignment by 11:59pm on Friday.</b></i></p>

### Lab 2 - QExpy Intro + Measuring the Acceleration of Gravity

<p>Download iPython notebook from OnQ (file should have extension .ipynb).</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FxcuuAu.png" width="200"></p>
<p>Log into <a href="https://queensu.syzygy.ca/">Syzygy</a> using your NetID and upload .ipynb file.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lxs0DXX.png" width="200"></p>
<p><i>One lab submission per group - try to have a different member submit each week</i>.</p>
<p>Refer to Appendix C of your textbook for guidelines on report writing. Be sure to delete all prompt text i.e. "double click to edit and answer questions." To save your notebook, use your browser menu. Go to File -> Print -> Save as PDF (or right click -> Print -> Save as PDF). Please check the print preview to ensure all your pages are there, and all your code is compiled and shows any output needed. Upload your whiteboard pictures and lab to the 'Labtorial x upload' dropbox on OnQ, by the end of day on Wednesday.</p>

### Extra Resources

<p>You can use LaTeX (lay-tech) math notation to input formulae, etc. into your reports by enclosing statements with dollar signs in a markdown (regular text) cell. $Everything in here would be in math mode!$ In the math mode environment, you can use LaTeX syntax to make it look nicer. Useful ones include;</p>

<p align="center">Fractions: $\frac{numerator}{denominator}$</p>
<p align="center">Super/subscripts: $x^{superscript}_{subscript}$</p>
<p align="center">Integrals: $\int^{upper limit}_{lower limit}$</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols">Pretty much any greek letter or math symbol you can think of!</a></p>

<p> For math review, I recommend videos from <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, particularly for calculus and vectors - <b>AP/College Calculus BC</b> looks to have a good overview, but a word of caution these videos go into more detail than we will cover in this course. <b>Precalculus</b> has some content on vectors, and there is some content on physics as well, including a <b>High school physics course</b> if you need review on that as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, don't hesitate to email me at <b>jmc24@queensu.ca</b> if you need clarification on points, or have some specific questions about something on the assignment, or need anything at all! My inbox is always open to you and it's my job to help.</p>
