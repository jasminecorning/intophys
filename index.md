### Nice to meet you!... Here's a quiz.

<p align="justify">You'll have bi-weekly quizzes, where here bi-weekly means once every two weeks (since apparently the definition can vary). Your first quiz is open-"book" (computer), but the rest will not be, though you will always be provided an extensive formula sheet. <i>You will write each quiz twice - once alone for 20 minutes, and again in your groups for 10 minutes.</i> I will take up the solutions to the quiz once everyone's done writing (unless everyone knows what's up, then I won't waste time).</p>

### Assignment 2 (aka Assignment 1)

<p align="center">Please work on: <b>Questions 1, 3, and 5</b>.</p>

<p align="justify">Do all work with your group on the provided whiteboard panels. Designate one group member per week to do all whiteboard writing, and rotate this every week. No notebooks! Take a picture of your whiteboard before erasing (recommended everyone takes their own picture). One group member should be designated per week to submit all pictures on OnQ, into the "Labtorial x upload" dropbox. These should be uploaded by the end of the labtorial period (5:30pm). <i><b>Whiteboard pictures are not graded on correctness, and do not count towards your assignment submission. Everyone should submit their own individual write-up of the assignment by midnight on Friday.</b></i></p>

<p align="justify">Each week one group will be chosen to lead a group discussion on one of the designated tutorial questions, starting with any work they've done. This week, I will lead to demonstrate. These discussions will be for the last 10-15 minutes of the tutorial section time slot.</p>

### Lab 2 (aka Lab 1)

* Download the 'Labtorial2' file from Week 2 on OnQ (extension .ipynb).
* Log into <a href="https://queensu.syzygy.ca/">Syzygy</a> using your NetID.
* You should now be in your directory 'tree' - look for /netid/tree in the url. Upload your Labtorial2 file.
* Click on the name of the file to open the notebook in a new tab, and follow the listed instructions.
  * This starts running what is called a 'kernel.' You can see the status of the kernel on the top menu bar - you should see a message telling you the kernel is starting, and then that kernel is ready upon the tab opening. <i>If your kernel freezes/stops running, go to the tab with your directory tree (/netid/tree) and refresh. <b>Do not refresh the page with your notebook, as unsaved work could be lost.</b> Once your tree reconnects, your notebook kernel should also.</i>
* Upload your group selfie through <a href="https://imgur.com">Imgur</a>. Once it's uploaded, right click to "Open Image in New Tab" and copy that direct image URL into the designated line on your notebook.
* <i>Installing QExpy:</i>
  * Once you've installed QExpy in the Terminal, save your notebook and close it. In your directory tree, select the notebook and hit the option "Shutdown." This will stop the kernel, and opening it again by clicking on the name will restart it. If you don't restart the kernel, your notebook won't recognize that QExpy has been installed.
* <i>Note:</i> Once you've ran your cell that imports QExpy, all following cells will have QExpy imported, so there's no need for additional import statements.
* <b>Everyone in the group with a laptop should at least go as far as installing and doing the basic QExpy functions, to get familiar with them. </b>Only one notebook needs to be submitted per group.
* To save your notebook, please use your <i>browser</i> menu. Go to File -> Print -> Save as PDF. Please check the print preview to ensure all your pages are there, and all your code is compiled and shows any outputs needed.
* Upload this PDF to the 'Labtorial x upload' dropbox on OnQ, by the end of the labtorial period (5:30pm).
