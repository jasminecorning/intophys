### Nice to meet you!... Here's a quiz.

<p align="center">You'll have bi-weekly quizzes, where here bi-weekly means once every two weeks (since apparently the definition can vary). Your first quiz was open-"book" (computer), but the rest will not be, though you will always be provided an extensive formula sheet. I will take up the solutions to the quiz once everyone's done writing (unless everyone knows what's up, then I won't waste time).</p>
