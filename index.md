# Week 5

### General Notes

<p align="justify">Reading Assignments - please try and participate in the Perusall discussions! Even if you understand all the material in a given week, you can answer questions from other students, or simply leave helpful tricks or things you find interesting. The goal is to make this a more active and engaged reading.</p>
<p align="justify">Lab Reports - make sure you are formatting and editing your reports. Just because it's a physics class and not english, doesn't mean it's acceptable to just write everything in one big paragraph.</p>

<p align="center">Please work on: <b>Questions 2, 4, 6</b>.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Note:</b> for Question 6, <i>do not</i> use potential energy.
<p align="justify">Do all work with your group on the provided whiteboard panels. Designate one group member per week to do all whiteboard writing, and rotate this every week. No notebooks! Take a picture of your whiteboard before erasing (recommended everyone takes their own picture). One group member should be designated per week to submit all pictures on OnQ, into the "Labtorial x upload" dropbox. These should be uploaded by the end of the labtorial period (5:30pm). <i><b>Whiteboard pictures are not graded on correctness, and do not count towards your assignment submission. Everyone should submit their own individual write-up of the assignment by midnight on Friday.</b></i></p>

<p align="justify">Each week (with no quiz) one group will be chosen to lead a group discussion on one of the designated tutorial questions, starting with any work they've done. These discussions will be for the last 10-15 minutes of the tutorial section time slot.</p>

### Lab 7

You can use LaTeX (lay-tech) math notation to input formulae, etc. into your reports by enclosing statements with dollar signs in a markdown (regular text) cell. $Everything in here would be in math mode!$ In the math mode environment, you can use LaTeX syntax to make it look nicer. Useful ones include;

<p align="center">Fractions: $\frac{numerator}{denominator}$</p>
<p align="center">Super/subscripts: $x^{superscript}_{subscript}$</p>
<p align="center">Integrals: $\int^{upper limit}_{lower limit}$</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols">Pretty much any greek letter or math symbol you can think of!</a></p>
