### Nice to meet you!... Here's a quiz.

<p align="justify">You'll have bi-weekly quizzes, where here bi-weekly means once every two weeks (since apparently the definition can vary). Your first quiz is open-"book" (computer), but the rest will not be, though you will always be provided an extensive formula sheet. <i>You will write each quiz twice - once alone for 20 minutes, and again in your groups for 10 minutes.</i> I will take up the solutions to the quiz once everyone's done writing (unless everyone knows what's up, then I won't waste time).</p>

### Assignment 2 (aka Assignment 1)

<p align="center">Please work on: <b>Questions 1, 3, and 5</b>.</p>

<p align="justify">Do all work with your group on the provided whiteboard panels. Designate one group member per week to do all whiteboard writing, and rotate this every week. No notebooks! Take a picture of your whiteboard before erasing (recommended everyone takes their own picture). One group member should be designated per week to submit all pictures on OnQ, into the "Labtorial x upload" dropbox. These should be uploaded by the end of the labtorial period (5:30pm). <i><b>Whiteboard pictures are not graded on correctness, and do not count towards your assignment submission. Everyone should submit their own individual write-up of the assignment by midnight on Friday.</b></i></p>

<p align="justify">Each week one group will be chosen to lead a group discussion on one of the designated tutorial questions, starting with any work they've done. This week, I will lead to demonstrate. These discussions will be for the last 10-15 minutes of the tutorial section time slot.</p>

### Lab 2 (aka Lab 1)

<p align="justify"><i>First half: Setting up group guidelines and learning the system.</i></p>

* Download the 'Labtorial2' file from Week 2 on OnQ (extension .ipynb).
* Log into <a href="https://queensu.syzygy.ca/">Syzygy</a> using your NetID.
* You should now be in your directory 'tree' - look for /netid/tree in the url. Upload your Labtorial2 file.
* Click on the name of the file to open the notebook in a new tab, and follow the listed instructions.
  * This starts running what is called a 'kernel.' You can see the status of the kernel on the top menu bar - you should see a message telling you the kernel is starting, and then that kernel is ready upon the tab opening. <i>If your kernel freezes/stops running, go to the tab with your directory tree (/netid/tree) and refresh. <b>Do not refresh the page with your notebook, as unsaved work could be lost.</b> Once your tree reconnects, your notebook kernel should also.</i>
* Upload your group selfie through <a href="https://imgur.com">Imgur</a>. Once it's uploaded, right click to "Open Image in New Tab" and copy that direct image URL into the designated line on your notebook.
