Take a picture of your whiteboard before erasing (recommended everyone takes their own picture). One group member should be designated per week to submit all pictures on OnQ, into the "Labtorial x upload" dropbox. These should be uploaded by the end of the labtorial period (5:30pm). <i><b>Whiteboard pictures are not graded on correctness, and do not count towards your assignment submission. Everyone should submit their own individual write-up of the assignment by midnight on Friday.</b></i></p>

<p align="justify">Each week one group will be chosen to lead a group discussion on one of the designated tutorial questions, starting with any work they've done. These discussions will be for the last 10-15 minutes of the tutorial section time slot.</p>
